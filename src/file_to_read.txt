Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar English pronunciation: /sAtUn tndulkr/ ( listen) AM (born 24 April 1973) is an Indian cricketer widely considered to be the greatest batsman of all time, after Don Bradman. In 2002, just 12 years into his career, Wisden ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Donald Bradman, and the second greatest one-day-international (ODI) batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[3] Tendulkar was a part of the 2011 Cricket World Cup winning Indian team in the later part of his career, his first such win in six World Cup appearances for India.[4] He was also the recipient of Player of the Tournament award of ICC World Cup, 2003 held in South Africa.

After a two-month break he is likely to return to test arena with the series against New Zealand commencing in late August 2012.[9]

Tendulkar has been honoured with the Padma Vibhushan award, India's second highest civilian award, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour. Tendulkar became the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of Group Captain by the Indian Air Force. He has received honorary doctorates from University of Mysore[10] and Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences[11] Sachin holds 12th rank in ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen as of August 2012.[12] On 1 August 2012, Sachin Tendulkar was nominated for the ICC People's Choice award for the third time.[13]
